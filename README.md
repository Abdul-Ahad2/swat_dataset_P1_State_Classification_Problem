The classification task is centered around predicting the operational state of a specific system component, represented by the target column P1_STATE. This is a binary classification problem, where:
 - Class 0: Represents one operational state of the component (e.g., normal operation).
 - Class 1: Represents another state (e.g., an anomaly or fault).
This classification is critical in monitoring and maintaining the SWAT system, as accurate predictions can help detect anomalies or faults early, thereby preventing system failures.
The code provided highlights the preprocessing steps for preparing the dataset for this classification task, ensuring that both numeric and categorical features are appropriately handled and scaled for effective machine learning model training.
